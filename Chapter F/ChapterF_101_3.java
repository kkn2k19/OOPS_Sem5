3. Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
Data members
1 - Name
2 - Age

It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee'
and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department'
respectively. Now, assign the name, age, phone number, address, and salary to an
employee and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and printing
the same.
